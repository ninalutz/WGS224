					<div class="content">
						<section>
							<p align = "left">The first step is to keep up with the news. New things are happening every day, and to be able to do something, you need to know what is going on around you, especially with your state government.</p>

							<p align = "left">The second step is to call your representatives. They have been elected to represent you, so let them know what you stand for. </p>

							<p align = "left">The third, and possibly most important, is VOTE. Not voting does not show that you are unsatisfied with anything, it shows indifference. By voting, you can help decide who is representing your interests.</p>

							<p align = "left">The fourth step is, if you can, support the organizations fighting for the right to access this procedure. It costs money to fight these legal battles so any money you can donate will help.</p>
							<p align = "left">Find your state representative and see policies being passed in your state <a href = "https://openstates.org/">here</a> </p>
							<p align = "left">Find your national representative <a href = "https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/map">here</a> </p>
							<h2>Organizations to support:</h2>
